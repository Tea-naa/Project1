Overview/ desciption of project::

Happy Paws Pet Adoption Agency is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming animals in need. Our mission is to connect loving families with pets, providing a safe and nurturing environment for each animal until they find their forever home. We believe every animal deserves a second chance at happiness and work tirelessly to ensure their well-being.

This project is the official repository for Happy Paws Pet Adoption Agency's website and management system. It includes:

Website: A user-friendly platform for potential adopters to browse available pets, learn about our adoption process, and fill out adoption applications.

Volunteer Management: Tools and resources for recruiting, managing, and communicating with volunteers who help with animal care, events, and administrative tasks.

Donation Portal: A secure and easy-to-use system for supporters to make contributions that help fund our rescue and rehabilitation efforts.
